Usage:
	playing:
		play notes by pressing keys on the (computer) keyboard or by clicking on the virtual keyboard.
		the notes are arrenged as so (QWERTY us layout):
			 ______________________
			||2|3|||5|6|7|||9|0|||=|
			||_|_|||_|_|_|||_|_|||_|
			|Q|W|E|R|T|Y|U|I|O|P|[|]|
			|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|

			|Z|X|C|V|B|N|M|,|.|/|
			|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|

	composing:
		when record is enabled, note input get added to the sequencer for the selected instrument at the active step.
		when you release all notes, they get added to the active step and active step advances by step add amount.
		press delete to erase all notes on the active step.

		to edit notes you can use pattern view, in here each grid position represents a step, when a step is active
		a rectangle gets drawn on the grid, it's height represents note velocity and it's width is note duration.
		add steps by left clicking the grid, remove them by right clicking.

		use the vertical scroll bar on the right (or octave shortcuts) to navigate pitch,
		use the top horizontal scroll bar (where the step numbers are located) to navigate steps.

		song are composed of 255 blocks (0 to FF) visible in the song bar in tone view,
		each block is made of a sequence for each tone, and each sequence is made of it's notes and the tone settings.
		song steps are the order in which the blocks are played,
		a song step can be assigned to any block and played for up to 64 beats.
		left click on a block number to jump to it.

		if song advance is on, song is played until it's length is reached or step FF is done.
		if song loop is on song will be played normally until loop point and then loop forever.
		if step tie is on, envelopes will carry between blocks, each step can decide to tie independantly of block.

		if record is active and changes are made to the automation matrix, an automation mark gets added to the sequencer step
		at the active step, these can be deleted without erasing the notes by pressing shift+delete

	tone editing:
		tones or instruments can be edited in the tone view with the knobs.
		a tone is composed by multiple oscilators, each oscilator has waveform, pitch, modulation parameters, mix
		and an amplitude envelope generator (EG) with 4 phases (attack, sustain, decay, release)

		modulation matrix parameters and mix (carrier amount) can be automated per step.

		the modulation matrix consists of a frequency ratio per osc and an index of modulation for
		each oscilator before it (osc 3 can be a carrier for osc 2 and 1 but not vice-versa).

		oscilator mix parameter lets every oscilator output it's generated value to the mix
		allowing multiple fm algorythms.

		each tone also has a gain knob and a pitch envelope generator.

		when editing a knob it's value is displayed in the top,
		while holding left click, you can round value to nearest integer by right clicking anywhere.
		hold shift while dragging a knob for finer control.
